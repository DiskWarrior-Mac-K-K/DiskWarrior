## Application Overview

DiskWarrior serves Mac users facing <a href="#">directory corruption</a> that threatens irreplaceable data. The utility addresses scenarios where standard Disk Utility cannot help and data recovery services seem like the only option.

<a href="#">APFS and HFS+ support</a> handles both modern and legacy Mac file systems appropriately. Whether drives use current APFS format or older HFS+, DiskWarrior applies appropriate rebuilding techniques for each file system type.

<a href="#">Bootable recovery</a> enables repairing startup drives that cannot mount normally. Boot from DiskWarrior recovery media to repair drives that prevent normal Mac startup due to directory damage.

<a href="#">Missing file recovery</a> locates files that disappeared due to directory corruption rather than actual deletion. Files still exist on disk but damaged directories lost track of them—DiskWarrior finds and reconnects these orphaned files.

<a href="#">Hardware monitoring</a> checks drive health indicators that predict potential failures. Identify drives developing problems before catastrophic failure occurs, enabling proactive data protection.

<a href="#">S.M.A.R.T. analysis</a> interprets drive self-monitoring data to assess reliability. Understanding drive health helps prioritize backup and replacement decisions based on actual condition.

<a href="#">Report generation</a> documents disk condition and repair results for reference. Maintain records of drive health assessments and recovery operations for IT documentation purposes.

<a href="#">File scavenging</a> recovers individual files from severely damaged disks even when complete directory rebuild isn't possible. Extract recoverable data from drives beyond full repair.

<a href="#">Directory comparison</a> shows differences between damaged original and rebuilt directories. Understand exactly what changed during repair for verification and documentation.
